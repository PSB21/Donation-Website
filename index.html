                    Till date, our group has put in whatever little money we had, for day to day expenses, from our
                    earnings.
                    Our team is mostly comprised of working people and ever since the COVID-19
                    pandemic hit us, most of us have lost our jobs and some of us are facing major pay cuts.

                    <h2>Plant a tree, so that the next generation can get air for free.
                    </h2><br>
                    Trees are vital for this planet as they give us oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, stabilize the soil
                    and
                    give
                    life to the world’s wildlife.
                    They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter. Despite their importance, human
                    beings
                    are
                    cutting them down for their worldly needs. This has to be minimized because
                    our life is not possible without trees. Instead of cutting them, we should grow more trees.

                    India's female literacy has gone up but still 22
                    percentage
                    points behind
                    world average; education among young women. Women education in India plays a very important role in
                    the
                    overall development of the country. It not only helps in the development of half of the human
                    resources, but
                    in improving the quality of life at home and outside. 1 If it is said that education is the key to
                    all
                    problems, then it won't be improper.
